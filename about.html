                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Aunix was founded by Bernu Britz after years of working within and alongside Managed Service Providers. We saw a recurring, critical challenge for MSPs of all sizes: the difficulty and high cost of providing fast, reliable, and professional on-site support across a wide geographical area. Projects were delayed, and potential clients were turned away because of logistical constraints.</p>
                    <p>We built this company to be the perfect solution to that problem. We are not another MSP; we are a dedicated, expert field services team that MSPs can rely on as their own. Our entire business model is built around empowering you to do more.</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>To empower South African MSPs with exceptional, reliable, and scalable outsourced IT services. We measure our success by the success and growth of our partners. We handle the hands-on work so you can focus on building relationships and recurring revenue.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Core Values</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Partnership:</strong> We function as an extension of your team, not a third-party vendor. Your goals are our goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> When we accept a job, it gets done right. You can count on us to be there on time and prepared.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Every interaction with your client reflects on your brand. Our technicians are courteous, skilled, and professional at all times.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> We understand that the IT world is dynamic. We adapt to your processes and your clients' unique needs.</li>
