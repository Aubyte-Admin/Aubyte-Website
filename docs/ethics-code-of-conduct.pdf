Aunix - Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy

Effective Date: 25/06/2025

1. Introduction and Purpose
This Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy outlines the principles and standards of professional behavior expected of all Aunix employees, contractors, and representatives. Our reputation is built on trust, integrity, and exceptional service. As a white-label partner to Managed Service Providers (MSPs), we have a dual responsibility: to uphold our own standards and to flawlessly represent our clients' brands.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all individuals working for or on behalf of Aunix, in all locations and at all times during their work.

3. Core Principles

3.1. Integrity and Honesty
All employees must act with the highest degree of integrity. This includes accurate time-tracking, honest reporting of work performed, and transparency with both Aunix management and our MSP partners.

3.2. Professionalism
Employees must maintain a professional demeanor, appearance, and communication style at all times, especially when on-site at an end-client's location. This includes being punctual, respectful, and courteous to all individuals.

3.3. Client Representation (White-Label Integrity)
As a white-label service provider, we are an extension of our MSP client's team.
- Employees must never identify themselves as Aunix employees to an end-client unless explicitly authorized.
- Employees must adhere to the specific professional and branding guidelines required by the MSP partner for each project.
- Company-branded materials (Aunix) are not to be used or displayed at an end-client's site.

3.4. Confidentiality
Employees will have access to sensitive information belonging to Aunix, our MSP partners, and their end-clients. All such information, including but not limited to technical data, passwords, business processes, and client lists, is strictly confidential and must not be disclosed or used for any purpose other than the performance of assigned duties.

4. Conflict of Interest
Employees must avoid any situation that could create a conflict of interest. This includes:
- Performing side-work for an MSP partner or end-client without Aunix's express written consent.
- Accepting gifts, entertainment, or other favors of significant value from clients or vendors.
- Using client information or relationships for personal gain.

5. Reporting Violations
Employees are encouraged and expected to report any suspected violations of this Code of Conduct to their direct manager or Aunix management without fear of retaliation.

6. Consequences of Violation
Violations of this policy are a serious matter and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment and potential legal action.
