        <summary>What is Managed IT?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Managed IT Services refer to the outsourcing of a company’s IT operations to a third-party provider, responsible for proactively managing and maintaining IT infrastructure and end-user systems. These services typically encompass help desk support, onsite assistance, network management, data backup and recovery, and software updates.</p>
            <p>The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and security of IT environments while minimising operational downtime and reducing the internal burden and cost of IT management. Managed IT Services offer businesses a scalable, cost-effective solution to ensure continuous performance and alignment with evolving technology requirements.</p>

        <summary>How does managed IT differ from break/fix IT services?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Break/fix IT services are reactive—you call for help when something breaks. Managed IT is proactive. Managed IT prevents issues before they happen and provide ongoing support for a predetermined rate. This approach reduces downtime, enhances security, and stabilises your IT costs.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is managed IT only for large businesses?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Not at all. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) often benefit the most from managed IT services. Managed IT provides enterprise-level support without the need for a full in-house IT department, helping SMBs stay competitive and secure while controlling costs.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will I still need an internal IT team?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>That depends on your business needs. Many companies fully outsource their IT support, while others retain a small internal team and use managed IT services to supplement expertise and manage specific functions. We work seamlessly alongside your in-house staff.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is support provided?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Remote support is provided through help desk tickets, live chat, and phone. On-site support is typically available when necessary. 24/7 or extended-hour support is offered to ensure issues are addressed quickly, minimising business disruption.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How much do managed IT services cost?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Pricing models vary. We typically use a flat-rate monthly fee based on the number of users, devices, or services included. This provides predictable budgeting. Costs scale with the business size and the complexity of the IT environment.</p>

        <summary>How do I know if managed IT service is right for my business?</summary>
