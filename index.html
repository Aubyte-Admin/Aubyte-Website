    <h2>The Team Behind Your Team</h2>
    <p>
      Aubyte was founded on a simple principle: to be the gold standard in IT field services.
      We saw a recurring challenge for MSPs: the difficulty of providing fast, cost-effective
      on-site support. We built this company to be the perfect solution—a dedicated, expert
      field team that MSPs can rely on as their own.
